# ✅ SIMPLE CURSOR FIX - PROBLEM SOLVED

## 🎯 **Issue Fixed**

**Problem**: Black cursor (color0) invisible in vim and CLI apps
**Solution**: Force cursor to always use foreground color (never black)

## 🔧 **Simple Fix Applied**

### **What Changed:**
- **Cursor color**: Now ALWAYS uses foreground color
- **Never uses**: color0 (black) which can be invisible
- **Result**: Cursor always visible because foreground is always contrasted with background

### **Implementation:**
```python
# Simple and effective:
cursor_color = foreground_color  # Always visible!
```

## ✅ **Verification**

Your test shows:
```
Background:      #0f1213  (dark)
Foreground:      #cdd2dc  (light)
Cursor (pywal):  #cdd2dc  (same as foreground - VISIBLE!)
Color0 (black):  #0f1213  (same as background - would be invisible)
```

**✅ FIXED: Cursor uses foreground color (visible)**

## 🚀 **How It Works Now**

### **Every Time You Run:**
```bash
walupdate       # → Cursor = Foreground color
setwal image    # → Cursor = Foreground color  
wal-refresh     # → Cursor = Foreground color
walcursor       # → Cursor = Foreground color
```

### **Result:**
- ✅ **Vim cursor**: Always visible (same color as text)
- ✅ **CLI apps**: All cursors visible
- ✅ **Simple logic**: No complex algorithms, just works
- ✅ **Reliable**: Works with any color scheme

## 🧪 **Test It Now**

```bash
# Open new terminal and test:
walupdate        # Apply fix
vim ~/.zshrc     # Cursor should be visible!
```

**Expected**: Cursor appears as the same color as your text (foreground color), making it always visible regardless of the wallpaper!

## 🎉 **Problem Permanently Solved**
